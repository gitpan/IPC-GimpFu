IPC-GimpFu

This module makes it possible to communicate with Gimp's script-fu
server, and also to start/stop it on the local machine.

From the synopsis, two tiny examples:

    use IPC::GimpFu;

    # Start locally if needed, keep running once we're done:
    my $gimp = IPC::GimpFu->new({ autostart => 1 });
    $gimp->run({ file => "gimp-source.scm" });
    $gimp->run("some command");

    # Use a remote server:
    my $remote_gimp = IPC::GimpFu->new({ server => "other-server", port => "other-port" });
    $remote_gimp->run("something else");


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

If the gimp binary isn't available, the first command can be changed
into:

	BYPASS_MISSING_GIMP=1 perl Makefile.P
